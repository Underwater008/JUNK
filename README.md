This repository contains a 3D terrain grid visualization demo built with Three.js. Open `terrain.html` in a browser to view and tweak controls.

- Ocean detection: grayscale threshold with flat sea height
- Land colors: sampled from a material map (with rotation/flip controls)
- Live controls: sea threshold, sea height, height scale, material rotation/flips
